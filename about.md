## ##NAME##

![Avatar ##NAME##](/assets/images/avatar-highres.png)

I am a software engineer from Hamburg, Germany. Over the years I worked in different roles on several projects for external customers and on inhouse projects for my employees. While I really do enjoy the technical part of the job I also like the team and project the possibility to create and build the best possible solution for all included people. If you want to more about my carrer path, check out my Xing profile or get in contact with me.

In my freetime I love travelling, hiking, bicycling and bouldering or - if the weather is bad - to watch good series and movies or play video games.

This websites purpose is not 100% set yet. I will see how it develops. Maybe some blog posts will follow... Who knows?
